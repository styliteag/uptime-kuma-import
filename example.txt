# The logic here is
# If a Line contains no ":" it is a Prefix for a Checkname
#  lines containing no : are prefixes/suffixes for checknames
#     The Rule is here:
#       if the name contains a "-"
#       then the part before the "-" is the suffix
#       and the part after the "-" is the prefix
# If a Line is parsed/contains a URL and a keyword
# if () is there it will be parsed for 999ms (milliseconds)

# This will be in the default group (AutoCheck)
